Charli XCX\'s quarantine album is, like, really, really good.

The 11 track album somehow captures the essence of lockdown with a heavy
dose of her signature envelope-pushing pop/PC Music blend. As a natural
introvert, sitting at home all day doesn\'t bother me. But that\'s
definitely not the case for Charli. She croons over glisteningly heavy
production from a star-studded production team consisting of PC Music
pioneer A. G. Cook and one-half of 100 gecs, Dylan Brady.

The opening track, *Pink Diamond*, immediately sets the scene with its
heavy mechanical sounds and her psychedelic \"I Just Wanna Real Go
Hard\" chant. It\'s followed by *forever*, a sweet ballad on which
Charli muses that she\'ll love her boyfriend forever, even if they never
see each other again. Similarly, *claws*, *I Finally Understand*, and *7
years* echo feelings of genuine affection.

*C2.0* interpolates *Click* (and turns it, pretty artfully, into clique)
from her *Pop 2* EP, and with Dylan Brady on the production, it\'s
easily one of the superior cuts on here. Brady can also be heard on
*Anthems* too, where Charli reflects on day-to-day lockdown life (*I\'m
so bored, woo/*

*Wake up late and eat some cereal/Try my best to be physical/Lose myself
in a TV show/Staring out to oblivion/All my friends are invisible*).

2019\'s Charli, which was polished and refined, sits in stark contrast
to this record. *how i'm feeling now* feels rough around the edges. It
feels like it was made on Zoom. It feels like it was made in a month.
And that not necessarily a bad thing. It feels genuine, unlike most
\"quarantine\" records (coronavirus by Tom MacDonald comes to mind).
It\'s gonna be interesting when we look back on this time-capsule of a
record in a few years. Oh, can't wait for this year to be over.
